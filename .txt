The page should list all the available staffs in the system on a table. It should hold a button that pops up a modal for adding a new staff that captures the following details:

FullName: Must only accept first and last names or first middle and last names. Must not accept only one name
Email Address: Must be valid
Phone Number: Must be a valid Nigerian number
Department: Gotten from a list of departments in the server
Unit: Same as departments
Address: Just a simple and regular address
Roles: Gotten from a list of roles in the server
State of Origin: A list of all Nigerian states
LGA: From each state
Country: Defaults to "Nigeria" not editable

The page should hold another button that pops up a modal for editing each staff listed.

It should have another button for deactivating a staff from the list.
